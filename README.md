# Quantitative Trading Model Testing Framework

## Overview

This repository houses a sophisticated quantitative trading model testing framework, designed for developing, backtesting, and analyzing algorithmic trading strategies. It demonstrates advanced skills in financial engineering, data analysis, and software development - core competencies highly valued in the fintech industry.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Asset Support
- Handles various financial instruments including cryptocurrencies, forex, and stocks.
- Flexible data ingestion from multiple sources (e.g., CCXT, MetaTrader).

### 2. Advanced Signal Generation
- Implements sophisticated technical indicators and custom signals.
- Supports trend-following and mean-reversion strategies.

```python:BTC_Tide.ipynb
def calculate_tide(close, period=14):
    # 2 state PSAR
    return tide

df['Tide'] = calculate_tide(df['close'])
```

### 3. Robust Backtesting Engine
- Simulates trading scenarios with high fidelity.
- Accounts for transaction costs, slippage, and other real-world factors.

```python:BTC_Tide.ipynb
def backtest_strategy(df, initial_balance=10000):
    balance = initial_balance
    position = 0
    trades = []
    
    for i in range(1, len(df)):
        if df['Signal'][i] == 1 and position == 0:
            # Buy logic
            position = balance / df['close'][i]
            balance = 0
            trades.append(('buy', df.index[i], df['close'][i]))
        elif df['Signal'][i] == -1 and position > 0:
            # Sell logic
            balance = position * df['close'][i]
            position = 0
            trades.append(('sell', df.index[i], df['close'][i]))
    
    return trades, balance + (position * df['close'].iloc[-1])
```

### 4. Performance Analytics
- Comprehensive set of performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdown, etc.).
- Interactive visualizations for in-depth strategy analysis.

![Performance Metrics](./images/performance_metrics.png)
*Figure 3: Key Performance Metrics of the Trading Strategy*

```python:performance_analytics/metrics.py
def calculate_sharpe_ratio(returns, risk_free_rate=0.02):
    excess_returns = returns - risk_free_rate/252
    return np.sqrt(252) * excess_returns.mean() / excess_returns.std()

def calculate_max_drawdown(returns):
    cumulative_returns = (1 + returns).cumprod()
    peak = cumulative_returns.expanding(min_periods=1).max()
    drawdown = (cumulative_returns/peak) - 1
    return drawdown.min()
```

### 5. Machine Learning Integration
- Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., CatBoost) for predictive analytics.
- Demonstrates the fusion of traditional quant methods with AI/ML techniques.

*Figure 4: Machine Learning Model Predictions vs Actual Price Movements*

```python:BTC_Tide.ipynb
from catboost import CatBoostRegressor

def train_catboost_model(X_train, y_train):
    model = CatBoostRegressor(iterations=1000, learning_rate=0.1)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model

model = train_catboost_model(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### 6. Real-time Trading Capabilities
- Includes a paper trading bot for strategy validation.
- Telegram integration for real-time alerts and monitoring.

```python:main/Trading_Bot.py
class TradingBot:
    def __init__(self, exchange, strategy, telegram_bot):
        self.exchange = exchange
        self.strategy = strategy
        self.telegram_bot = telegram_bot

    def run(self):
        while True:
            current_data = self.exchange.fetch_ohlcv('BTC/USDT', '1h')
            signal = self.strategy.generate_signal(current_data)
            if signal != 0:
                self.execute_trade(signal)
                self.telegram_bot.send_message(f"Executed trade: {signal}")
            time.sleep(3600)  # Wait for 1 hour before next iteration
```
